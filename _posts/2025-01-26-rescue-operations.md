## **Rescue Tips for the Community**

### **1. Stay Calm in an Emergency**
If you’re involved in an accident or flood:
- **Remain calm and call 911.**
- Provide accurate information about your location and situation.

### **2. Avoid Entering Floodwaters**
- Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can knock an adult off their feet, and 12 inches can carry away most vehicles.
- **Turn Around, Don’t Drown**: Avoid driving through flooded roadways.

### **3. Stay Visible**
- If trapped in a vehicle, turn on hazard lights and use a flashlight or reflective materials to signal for help.
