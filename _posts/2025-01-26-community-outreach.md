Community outreach is at the heart of what we do at Mountain Springs Fire and Rescue. Beyond responding to emergencies, we work to educate, connect, and empower our neighbors.

## What Our Outreach Programs Offer

- **Fire Safety Education**: Workshops on fire prevention, home safety, and emergency planning for families and businesses.
- **Smoke Detector Installation**: Ensuring every home is equipped with working smoke alarms.
- **School Visits**: Engaging with students to teach fire safety in a fun and interactive way.
- **Community Events**: Participating in local festivals, parades, and fairs to strengthen community ties and share safety tips.

## Why It Matters

Our outreach programs are designed to create a safer, more informed community. By working together, we can prevent emergencies before they happen and ensure everyone is prepared for the unexpected.
